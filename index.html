                    <p class="text">A sports car, is a small, usually two-seater automobile
                        designed for spirited performance and nimble handling. 
                        The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in 1919. 
                        According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, USA's first known 
                        use of the term was in 1928. Sports cars started to become 
                        popular during the 1920s.</p>
                    <p class="text">Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high 
                        maneuverability and light weight are requisite. Sports cars 
                        are usually aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a 
                        lower center of gravity than standard models. Steering and 
                        suspension are typically designed for precise control at high 
                        speeds. Traditionally sports cars were open roadsters, but 
                        closed coupés also started to become popular during the 1930s, 
                        and the distinction between a sports car and a grand tourer is 
                        not absolute.</p>
